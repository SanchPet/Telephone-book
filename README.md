# About the program
Thanks you for your interest in my project.
This is a consol version of a telephone book made as a homework that I recieved on my C# courses in ITMO University.
The pogram has a __sessional inormation storage__, so all the notes are available during only one session.

Main objective was to train new beginner skills that we learned in courses (work with classes and objects, data input, information stroing, simple methods and logic)

__IMPORTANT INFO!__ The program is made on __Russian__ language, so I guess it can be used only by Russian-speakers.

## Features:

In the app you can __create a new note__ about person that contains name, surname, mobile number y etc.
You can __redact__ or __delete__ existing notes.  
You can __see the list of all notes__ and __see any note in details__

Program interacts with user in a dialog format, recieving commands from keyboard.
